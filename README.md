# Study Saturdays: Week 4 - Fullstack Flow (Cycle 2)

## **Objective:** Build a form to add new students to our app

### Steps

In the `NewStudentForm` component, do the following:
  - [ ] Add a local state (you will have to determine the necessary data we will need to house in `this.state`)
  - [ ] Add a `handleChange` method that will update the `state` according to the form's input
  - [ ] Add a `handleSubmit` method that will take the data from `state` and ***do*** something with it (you can surmise what that something is) ***and*** clear the `state` (and thus the form)
- [ ] Once done and tested, `git checkout cycle-3`
