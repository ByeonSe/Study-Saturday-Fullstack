# Study Saturdays: Week 4 - Fullstack Flow (Cycle 1)

## **Objective:** Build a form to add new students to our app

### Steps

- [ ] Create a button that reads, "Add New Student," in the `Main` component
  - The button should "toggle" the form
  - The form should be "[hidden](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/hidden)" by default
    - _Reference:_ [MDN: HTMLElement.hidden](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/hidden)
- [ ] Create a new component (in its own file) called "`NewStudentForm`," that will render a form with ***three*** input fields (First Name, Last Name and Email) and a way to submit (i.e. either `<button>` _or_ `<input type="submit">`)
  - _References:_
    - [MDN: Your first form](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Your_first_form)
    - [MDN: <form>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)
- [ ] Once done and tested, `git checkout cycle-2`
